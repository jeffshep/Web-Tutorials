for (var i = 2 ; i < 13; i++){

/* first part starting point, second part ends the loop at a certain point,
third will increment (i+=3)*/

Small complication: the position (or the index) of each bit of data is 
counted starting from 0, not 1.

var cities = ["London", "Amman", "Helsinki", "NYC", "Exeter"];

for (var i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
    console.log("I would like to visit " + cities[i]);
}
//Remember to set your condition outside the loop!
var count = 0

var loop = function(){
	while(count < 3){
		console.log("I'm looping!")
		count++
	}
};

loop();
